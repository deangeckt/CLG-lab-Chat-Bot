  "system_common_map_prefix": "Here are some details of the map and the path that only YOU know.",
  "map_1": "The path starts at the top-right corner of the map; the USER is already there.\nStep 1: A few steps left of it there is a small island on which a leopard is resting; the correct path passes through this island, just below the leopard.\nStep 2:The path then crosses on a wooden twig that leads to a larger island on which there are a parrot and an elephant.\nStep 3:The path goes over the head of the parrot and then down (south) between the parrot and the elephant.\nStep 4: The path then leaves this island in a south-eastern direction, over 3 rocks (2 gray ones and a darker one).It then reaches a new island with a frog on it.\nStep 5: The path goes below (south of) the frog and then does a u-turn to the left (west).\nStep 6: The path then crosses over the back of a crocodile, back to the island with the parrot and the elephant, this time going left (west).\nStep 7: Then, the path crosses over two gray rocks towards an island with a giraffe. The giraffe is located at the left side of the map.\nStep 8: The path goes below the giraffe (south-west), then turns 90 degrees to the left (south-east) and crosses to another island with a snake on it.\nStep 9: It goes over the snake and then reaches the final objective: the treasure.",
  "map_2": "The path starts at the top-right (north-east) corner of the map, where a white dog is sitting; The USER is already there.\nStep 1: The correct path is taking few steps left (west), below a wooden bench, and crosses a trail towards a florist stand. But it doesn't reach the florist stand; instead, it u-turns 180 degrees to the left, crosses the trail again, and heads back toward the white dog.\nStep 2: The path crosses over the branch, to the south, and continues southwards (down the map).There is another white dog sitting next to a red and white checkered picnic.\nStep 3: The path goes over the mat, touching a bowl of berries, and continues to the west.\nStep 4: Then there is another wooden branch that crosses the river again, this time to the north.\nStep 5: Once the river is crossed, the path avoids touching a green bush but rather circles it from the right, until it reaches the florist stand.\nStep 6: The path then turns left (west), goes below the stand, and reaches a big bridge with two people riding a bicycle.The path passes the bridge to the west. \nStep 7: Just past the bridge, two elderly people are sitting on a bench reading newspapers.\nStep 8: The path moves south a few steps, between the old people and another wooden branch, and reaches a green bush next to the end of the wooden branch.\nStep 9: The path then goes east, between the branch and the bush.\nStep 10: A few steps to the east there is a brown young deer. This is the final objective.",
  "map_3": "The path starts at the top (north) part of the map, at the opening of a tent; The USER is already there.\nStep 1: Next, the correct path takes a few steps south of the tent, goes on a trail, and reaches a puppy.\nStep 2: The paths turns left (east) under the young dog and continues a few steps to the east, until it reaches a small bonfire north of the trail.\nStep 3: It leaves the trail, overtakes the fire on the left (north) and continues to head east on the trail.\nStep 4: The path then passes under two red mushrooms and reaches a blue car.\nStep 5: It does not touch the car; instead, it makes a right u-turn and heads back west to where the road forks.\nStep 6: At the fork, the path takes the left (south) branch and passes east of a telescope.\nStep 7: It then veers right and takes an off-trail shortcut, going around the telescope until it returns to the trail.\nStep 8: The path continues west on the trail, then leaves it and crosses a low wall of rocks that surround a wooden cabin. This cabin is the final objective.",
  "map_4": "The path starts at the top (north-east) part of the map, near a group of three palm trees; The USER is already there.\nStep 1: Next, the correct path goes under the first tree to the south-west, turns right and crosses the second palm tree, then turns sharply to the left before the third tree and progresses southward.\nStep 2: After a few steps, the path moves to the left of a brown puppy. It turns slightly left and then turns right to the south.\nStep 3: The path crosses between a big rock (on the west) and a small rock (on the east) and reaches the ocean, or some other body of water.\nStep 4: It enters the water and faces a large red crab. It then turns right (west) and goes along the big rock, continuing westwards in the water.\nStep 5: After going along a third, medium rock, the path faces a shark in the water, and makes a sharp turn to the right.\nStep 6: The path goes back to the land, crosses between the medium rock and a blue-yellow-white ball, and continues north.\nStep 7: It then veers slightly left and goes to the north-west, crossing between a red tent on the left and a larger speaker on the right.\nStep 8: The path circles around the tent in an arc and then continues south towards the sea. But it doesn't reach the water: just at the shore it turns right (west) and goes below a red kayak.\nStep 9: Then, the path turns 90 degrees to the right (north), moves along the kayak and reaches a small green bush. This is the final objective."
